# GapChart
Shows the rider time gaps per lap.

This screen allows you to understand the structure of the race by lap including
which riders rode together, which bridged, the composition of chase groups and when they formed, and who was lapped.

It tells the epic story of the race from beginning to end.

It is also useful as a quick check to see which riders were lapped and when, and whether there are any errors.

# Screen
The gap time (time following the leader) for each rider is shown per lap.

Hover your mouse pointer close to the gap lines to see more detail.

Click-and-drag to get a difference line.  This makes it easy to measure differences between groups.
