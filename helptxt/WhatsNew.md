# What's New in CrossMgr

## July 21, 2021
A new [SetLaps][] dialog was added.

__Set Laps__ allows you to easily change the number of laps while the race is running.
If provides all information about the current number of laps and the new proposed number including the winner's time and the time of the last rider on course (taking potential lapping into account, of course).

See [SetLaps][] for details.



## July 15, 2021

SprintMgr was updated.  In addition to many bug fixes and upgrades, a new Competition format was added.
